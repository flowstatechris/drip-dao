# DripDAO: My first ever fully deployed dApp


### This dApp lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly 
by a governance contract

This project created a DAO through:
- deploying a custom ERC-20 token
- deploying a ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join the DAO
- deploying a governance contract + treasury


#### thanks for the help @_buildspace ;)
